/**
 In a deck of cards, each card has an integer written on it.
 Return true if and only if you can choose X >= 2 such that it is possible to split the entire deck into 1 or more groups of cards, where:
 Each group has exactly X cards. All the cards in each group have the same integer.
 
 Example 1:
 Input: deck = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]
 Output: true
 Explanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4].
 
 Example 2:
 Input: deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]
 Output: falseÂ´
 Explanation: No possible partition.
 
 Example 3:
 Input: deck = [1]
 Output: false
 Explanation: No possible partition.
 
 Example 4:
 Input: deck = [1,1]
 Output: true
 Explanation: Possible partition [1,1].
 
 Example 5:
 Input: deck = [1,1,2,2,2,2]
 Output: true
 Explanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[2,2].
